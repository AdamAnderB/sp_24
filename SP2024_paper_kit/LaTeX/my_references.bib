               difficulties to cope with outliers. Detecting outliers by
               determining an interval spanning over the mean plus/minus three
               standard deviations remains a common practice. However, since
               both the mean and the standard deviation are particularly
               sensitive to outliers, this method is problematic. We highlight
               the disadvantages of this method and present the median absolute
               deviation, an alternative and more robust measure of dispersion
               that is easy to implement. We also explain the procedures for
               calculating this indicator in SPSS and R software.",
